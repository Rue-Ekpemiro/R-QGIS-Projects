## Description of the data and file structure

Demographic and analytical results of samples for plastics using pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (PyGCMS). "Null" is used to denote cells where log-transformed values of zero would cause an error. "Unknown" refers to data lost in the record.
